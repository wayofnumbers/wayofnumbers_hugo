**Finally got my hands on the**[**fastbook**](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527)**. SO excited!**

Thanks, [Jeremy Howard](https://medium.com/u/34ab754f8c5e), and Sylvain Gugger for putting the book together and the great [fast.ai](http://fast.ai)[course](https://course.fast.ai/) that put me on this journey! Can’t wait to start the reading! For people don’t know what the fast.ai course is, look no further my piece here:
